# home-appliance-xml
Home appliance sample application

We built this sample drawing the UI with Android XML + TotalCross + KnowCode API. Now it is possible to run this sample on Windows Desktop, Linux, Linux ARM (raspberry, Toradex, NXP, etc), iOS, Android, and more.

The KnowCode library or this sample doesn't use anything from Android on the device

Take a look at the UI
